# Implementation of HiDDeN - Hiding Data in MNIST

Based on _HiDDeN: Hiding data with deep networks (Zhu et al., 2018)_

This is a preliminary implementation.

## Requirements

- Tensorflow 2.0
- Scikit-Learn

## Examples

Here some examples after training on a few epochs. From left to right: Cover Image, Encoded Image, Difference Image.
